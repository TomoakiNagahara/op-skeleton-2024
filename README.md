# The "onepiece-framework" is insanely great!!

## 2025 are can everything want to do!!

## 2024 is not yet THE PEAK!!

### The hook-the-hooks

 OP is hooks the `git push` command. If you don't have CI/CD running, `git push` will fail.
 This trick is set up when you run `php assets/git/init.php`.
 Please do not worry. If you have configured your own git hooks, the hook-the-hooks won't get in the way.

### The PICK

 The PICK is easy to the pick of commit.

## 2022 had a big change!!

 The first is `OP()` function.
 `OP()` makes it easy to access the same functionality in any namespace.
 For details, please refer to the following URL: `develop:/reference/core/OP`

 The second is "CI/CD".
 The onepiece-framework includes its own "CI/CD".
 "CI" is automatically inspect all your code.
 Inspected code only will be delivery via "CD".
 And they work with GitHub Action.

 The third is "The develop module".
 Integrated everything. There are `selftest`, `admin`, `testcase` and `reference`.

# The "NEW WORLD" is a new world!!

 * True MVC Completed
 * Intuitive file structure
 * HTML pass through

## True MVC Completed

 MVC is not wrong.
 Until now, the implementation method was wrong.
 The "NEW WORLD" solved it in a very simple way.

 * Model is each `Unit`
 * View is  each directory located files.
 * Controller is each directory located `index.php` files.

## Intuitive file structure

 You won't get lost.

## What does "HTML pass through" mean?

 "HTML pass through" is directly output HTML.
 Until now, Old style MVC is required an empty controller.
 The onepiece-framework's NEW WORLD is does not need a controller.
 Of course it will be doing layout.

# Apology

## About English

 Our do not care about the strictness of English.

## UTF-8 only

 Only UTF-8 is supported.

## Microsoft Windows products is not support

 Our do not support a Microsoft Windows products.
 Because to keep clean source code.
 But, Windows Subsystem for Linux should work probably.

# 2022 to 2024

 * asset:/config/op.php  > `_OP_APP_BRANCH_`
