# The "NewWorld" is a new world!!

 * True MVC Completed
 * Intuitive file structure
 * Html pass through

## True MVC Completed

 MVC is not wrong.
 Until now, the implementation method was wrong.
 The "NEW WORLD" solved it in a very simple way.

 * Model is each `Unit`
 * View is  each directory located files.
 * Controller is each directory located `index.php` files.

## Intuitive file structure

 You won't get lost.

## What does "Html pass through" mean?

 "Html pass through" is directly output HTML.
 Until now, Old style MVC is required an empty controller.
 The onepiece-framework's NEW WORLD is does not need a controller.
 Of course it will be doing layout.

## Microsoft Windows products is not support

 Our do not support a Microsoft Windows products.
 Because to keep clean sourse code.
 But, Windows Subsystem for Linux should work probably.
